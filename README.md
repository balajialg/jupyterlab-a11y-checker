# jupyterlab-a11y-checker
This tool performs multiple accessibility checks on Jupyter notebook/Lab cells containing images and headings. It verifies the presence of alt-text for images, ensuring that visually impaired users can understand their content. Additionally, it calculates the color contrast ratio to ensure readability for users with low vision and identifies any transparency issues in images. Furthermore, it evaluates the heading structure to align with WCAG standards, ensuring that headers (h1, h2, etc.) are appropriately structured for optimal accessibility.
